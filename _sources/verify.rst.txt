Verify Installation
===================

Jupyter QtConsole
-----------------

If you would like to test that your installation is working properly, you can
run a small test example by opening the "Qt Console". This is an interactive
Python interpreter that allows you to type in Python statements directly. You
can start the Qt Console from within the "HyperSpy-bundle Prompt", which you will
find in the Start Menu:

Once the HyperSpy-bundle prompt opens, type ``jupyter qtconsole`` and press "Enter"
to launch the Qt Console:

   Launching the QT console from the HyperSpy-bundle prompt

The Qt Console is an interactive Python interpreter that allows you to enter
Python statements directly and immediately see their output. Once the console
has opened and you see a prompt that says ``In [1]:``, copy the following code
snippet at the location of the blinking cursor:

..  code-block:: python

    %matplotlib qt
    import exspy
    s = exspy.data.EELS_MnFe()
    s.remove_background()

Very briefly, this code is loading the interactive plotting libraries, loading
eXSpy, creating an artificial EELS signal, and then telling the interpreter you
want to interactively remove the power law background. Press ``Shift-Enter``
within the console to run the lines of code you pasted in (it may take a few
moments to run if this is the first time you've used HyperSpy on your machine):

   Entering the example code into the Qt Console.

Eventually, you should see a spectrum window and a small tool window for
removing the background open (they may be stacked on top of each other;
drag them out of the way, if so). If you click and drag on part of the spectrum
display, HyperSpy will fit a Power Law to the signal within that region,
and also show you a preview of the signal with the background subtracted:

.. figure:: _static/bundle_test_bgremoval.gif
   :width: 100 %
   :alt: Removing the background from a test signal
   :figwidth: 90%

   By clicking and dragging on the spectrum display, a region is created (shown
   in red). The fitted background is shown in blue, and a preview of the
   signal after background subtraction is displayed in green.

Clicking "OK" in the *Background removal tool* window will perform the
background subtraction, and replace the window with one showing the resulting
signal:

.. figure:: _static/bundle_test_bgremoval_sig.png

   Display of the signal after the background has been subtracted.

Jupyter Lab / Notebook
----------------------

The same test example as above can be run in the jupyter lab or jupyter notebook -
open the HyperSpy-bundle prompt and type ``jupyter lab`` or ``jupyter notebook``
and press "Enter".

.. note::
   As an alternative, you can use the :ref:`context menu shorcuts <context_menu_shortcuts-label>`
   to run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook.
